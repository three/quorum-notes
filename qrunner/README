I haven't used this in a while but qrunner is designed to be a Docker container
capable of running both the frontend or backend. For instance you could do
something like,

    docker run \
        -v "$PWD:/code:delegated" \
        -v "$HOME/dev/home:/root" \
        -v "$QUORUM_TOOLS_DIR:/opt/quorumtools" \
        --rm -it \
        python manage.py runserver_plus 0.0.0.0:8000

I think this was useful for getting Quorum running on Linux in an isolated
environment. There was probably more setup that was necessary.
