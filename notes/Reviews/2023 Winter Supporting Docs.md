## Description
"Senior Software Engineers at Quorum have developed the skills and experience to have an impact far beyond themselves. They not only own key portions of Quorum's infrastructure, produce individual work of the highest quality, and set technical directions and prioritities for the team, but also they regularly support and mentor other members of the team. Senior Software Engineers drive the rest of the team forward by developing systems that anticipate problems before they occur and take full ownership of entire systems from implementation to deployment and beyond.

Senior Software Engineers are distinguished by their ability to self-direct both in their technical contributions and in the planning, scoping, and leadership of projects. They are capable of leading implementation of projects, delegating appropriately to other team members, and can execute complete projects without oversight or regular support.”

# Quorum Company Values
Taken from *A. Quorum Company Values*

## Invest in People
At Quorum, our greatest asset is the people around us. We focus on building meaningful relationships with and caring for the people who inspire us: our clients, our potential clients, and our team.
We invest in our clients and our potential clients: making them successful is at the heart of everything we do. We invest in client relationships from the moment that an individual first learns about our company, to when they depart a client organization and beyond. We seek to add value to their work and provide solutions to both strategic and in-the-weeds challenges. We strive to ensure that every user is delighted with Quorum because we believe building strong relationships is both good business and the right thing to do. As a company we only succeed when our clients succeed. Each of our products is a direct reflection of the feedback we’ve received from our clients and represents our steadfast commitment to build a platform that is indispensable to our users. 

We invest in our team: building connections with our team members makes us a stronger team and our work more joyful. We bring on team members from a diverse range of backgrounds and work to create an inclusive environment that sets everyone up to succeed. We build relationships with each other inside and outside of business hours through outings, coffees with new hires, team events, and more. We care for one another beyond the walls of the office because we recognize the importance of bringing one’s entire self to work. We invest in each others’ growth and professional development because individual career growth not only helps Quorum become a more successful company, but also helps our team learn and flourish. 
Here are some questions you can ask yourself to help you invest in our clients, potential clients, and team:
* Am I thinking creatively about how I can provide meaningful solutions to a potential client’s challenge?
* What problem can I help solve for a team member or client?
* Am I contributing to a positive and inclusive environment?
* How can I better understand and support the people I’m working with?
* How can I help peers improve their skills and grow in their careers and lives?

## Take the Lead
At Quorum, every member of our team can and should lead. We believe that it's everyone's responsibility to push themselves and the team forward by identifying and pursuing opportunities, small and large. We set the team standard by acting with integrity without being prompted. We notice when things need to be fixed and step up for projects that improve our company. Every day we’re aspirational, yet work diligently to put ideas into action. Leadership isn’t management – everyone, regardless of role, can proactively find ways to improve our team, product, and company.
Here are some questions you can ask yourself to help you take the lead:
* What problems can I fix that aren't being addressed?
* How can I make our team better?
* What systems or processes should I try to improve?
* Where can I go beyond my job description to make an impact?

## Own the Execution
At Quorum, we demonstrate execution from start to finish. Owning the execution means that when we say we’ll do something, we follow through. We own the execution by taking responsibility for quality and results, good or not. We share updates, regardless of status, to provide clarity and manage expectations. We commit to finding solutions instead of placing blame, ask for help if necessary, and lend a hand to help get projects across the finish line. We strive to be relentlessly reliable because we care deeply about every aspect of what we do, and know that others count on us to do our work and do it well. Consistent execution helps build a better team, a better product, and a better company. 
Here are some questions you can ask yourself to help you own the execution:
* How do I keep people in the loop as I execute?
* How can I ensure I am reliable?
* Am I following through on the commitments that I made?
* What can I prioritize to allow others to move their work forward?

## Embrace The Rumble 
At Quorum, we embrace the rumble. A rumble is a respectful discussion where you can take a risk, be vulnerable, ask any type of question, or explain a mistake while being confident that others will accept and support you in moving forward. To rumble well, we focus on identifying solutions rather than placing blame. We tackle tough conversations while showing genuine concern. We appreciate diverse perspectives by assuming positive intent. We use small moments to build trust and demonstrate respect for others, especially when we disagree. When someone says "let's embrace the rumble," that is our cue to have a direct, courageous conversation that helps the team learn and grow.
Here are some questions you can ask yourself to help you embrace the rumble:
* When I disagree with someone, am I doing so in a respectful manner?
* How can I learn from my fellow team members’ experiences and perspectives?
* How can I be more supportive of my team members when they express their opinions?
* What solution can I bring to the table?
