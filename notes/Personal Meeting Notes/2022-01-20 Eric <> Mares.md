## Lattice Update

### What did you focus on last week?
I merged the ticket to give an error for attempts to archive objects attached to transactions, after improving testing. I picked up and made two PRs related to the cash on hand ticket, which have been blocked by awaiting review. On Friday I started the void dialog ticket while waiting for review on those.
I also completed my bi-annual review.

## What are your plans and priorities for this week?
Continue my tickets, and pick up new ones. Might make sense to pick up the bulk uploads archive ticket since that's directly tied to the one merged this week.
