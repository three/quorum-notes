*Learn Software Development* by Poppendieck

What was your favorite thing about the book? Keeping focused on one thing at a time. When many things are open constantly context switching kill productivity. Related, aggressively getting rid of blockers.

What were some practical take aways, concepts or tools you can use from the book? When I'm finished a ticket or am blocked the first two things I'm going to do is (1) ask for help unblocking it and (2) help other people unblock their tickets.

What surprised you most or something that challenged your current views? Did it change your opinion? Will you remember it a year from now? Optimizing for indivisual bussiness does not lead anywhere close to optimal results. I appreciated the story about the machines that were optimized to be fully used all the time. Reading the story it seems obvious what went wrong, yet I can see how the logic made sense when the decision was made.
