Things to discuss
 * Cision aquisition, and how things are going

## Takeaways
 * Regarding pull request processes
	 * It shouldn't take more than a few days to merge a PR
	 * Try to avoid multiple back and forths
	 * Maybe have "office hours" where things can be unblocked, could help with async having Michael/Mares in California
	 * Talk about this stuff in your retroes, it's a process
 * Regarding PAC and future plans
	 * We're trying to do a better job hiring, playing tricks like closing/reopening LinkedInJob postings
	 * It will be helpful once we get a recruiter
	 * We'll release initial PAC version near end of 2022 Q1, and get help from CisionPAC people Q2. Plans not set in stone.
