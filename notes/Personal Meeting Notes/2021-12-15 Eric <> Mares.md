Feedback for me:

(rough quote) "You do a good job jumping into hard things and trying to figure out what's happening. That's a good trait but sometimes it seems to lead you into making wrong assumptions. You should collaborate with the team more."

Action Item: Before each coding ticket, try to talk with the team before spending a significant amount of effort on a solution
