Undocumented commands:
======================

ipdb> help break
b(reak) ([file:]lineno | function) [, condition]
With a line number argument, set a break there in the current
file.  With a function name, set a break at first executable line
of that function.  Without argument, list all breaks.  If a second
argument is present, it is a string specifying an expression
which must evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored.

The line number may be prefixed with a filename and a colon,
to specify a breakpoint in another file (probably one that
hasn't been loaded yet).  The file is searched for on sys.path;
the .py suffix may be omitted.

ipdb> help step
s(tep)
Execute the current line, stop at the first possible occasion
(either in a function that is called or in the current function).

ipdb> help next
n(ext)
Continue execution until the next line in the current function
is reached or it returns.
