# Week of January 24

## [x] QPAC-456 Fix Void date description dialog**
https://quorumanalytics.atlassian.net/browse/QPAC-456
Work for this is in the `temp/qpac-456-inprogress` branch

## [ ] Looking into Typescript*
https://github.com/QuorumUS/quorum-site/pull/24722
[[Integrating Typescript in Frontend Codebase]]

## [X] QPAC-490 Missing Employer field in Bulk Uploads
https://quorumanalytics.atlassian.net/browse/QPAC-490
https://github.com/QuorumUS/quorum-site/pull/24777

## [ ] QPAC-449 Transactions Bulk Uploads error
https://quorumanalytics.atlassian.net/browse/QPAC-449

To Reproduce:
```
python manage.py shell_plus --use_prod_aws -c 'bu=BulkUploadFile.objects.unsafe_get(id=55875);bu.status=BulkUploadStatus.queued;bu.save();management.call_command("parse", "individual_contributions", bulk_upload_file=bu)'
```

Comes down to three issues I think
 * If a supporter doesn't exist we don't attempt to create them, but we should
 * If we don't have a transaction method it fails in weird ways down the road
 * There's a caching issue with batches, probably related to transaction rollbacks
