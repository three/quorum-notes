# Week of April 4

## [X] QPAC-591 Power search bug**
https://quorumanalytics.atlassian.net/browse/QPAC-591
https://github.com/QuorumUS/quorum-site/pull/25422
 * Need to add cypress test

## QPAC-638 PAC Bulk Upload Refinements
Branch `temp/QPAC-638`
 * Looks like batches are per-date so need to figure out a way around that (both BU date and batch date)

## Typescript Part 1*
https://github.com/QuorumUS/quorum-site/pull/25203

It's something with how packages are installed. I think the only way to fix this is to maker changes to `package.json` one by one and update `package-lock.json`.

## Test picker, travis_terminate error
https://github.com/QuorumUS/quorum-site/pull/25555
 * Just need to merge after CI passes

## Throw away code
```python
    match = re.match(r'^\s*\$?([0-9\s,]+)(\.([0-9\s,]{2}))?$', amount)
    if not match:
        log_error(u"Invalid amount {}".format(amount), send_to_user=True)
    value = 0L
    dollars_str = match.groups()[0]
    value += long(re.sub(r" |,", "", dollars_str)) * 100L
    cents_str = match.groups()[1]
    if cents_str:
        value += long(re.sub(r" |,", "", cents_str))
```
