# Week of January 18
Monday off for MLK.

## [X] QPAC-295 Incorrect Beginning Cash on Hand*

https://github.com/QuorumUS/quorum-site/pull/24617 (backend)
https://github.com/QuorumUS/quorum-site/pull/24662 (frontend)

## [ ] QPAC-456 Fix Void date description dialog*
https://quorumanalytics.atlassian.net/browse/QPAC-456
Work for this is in the `temp/qpac-456-inprogress` branch

## Looking into Typescript
https://github.com/QuorumUS/quorum-site/pull/24722
 * We can do parts of the code at a time
 * Flow types will have to be removed beforehand, lest tsc break
 * For it to be useful, DjangIO conversion will probably be necessary
