 - [x] **by Wednesday** get Technical Design Document

External Blockers: Radio Buttons

local branch `temp/QPAC-616`

Tasks:
  - [ ] Finish factoring out selectors
  - [ ] Make Pull Request

## Typescript
I think the issue actually involves upgrading npm (and maybe related to changes in `package-lock`). Basically there's no issue in the web application, but when we `require("react")`  it actualy requires the version in `QuorumDesign`. Before, `QuorumDesign` didn't have its own `react` version, but maybe a change with `peerDependencies` messed it up (I don't think we use peer dependencies correctly).

Question is, **how do other packages deal with this?** Is it just a matter of some order of reinstalling node_modules?
