## Entity Autofill After Create

Shared files are importing what they shouldn't
```
shared/pac/reducer.js
shared/pac/types.js
shared/profiles/organization/organization-profile-action-types.js
```

## Not itemizing Refund
Progress in branch `temp/items`

```
should_itemize_transaction
_populate_col_a_total_itemized_contributions_from_non_committees
FecForm3XSubmission.populate
FecForm3XSubmission.generate
generate_dot_fec_file_and_upload_pdf_for_form3x_endpoint
