Week of 2021-09-13

 Week of Septemer 13

## Monday (WFH)

I'm having a bunch of problems with [QI-8424 Other Information Form](:/cbcf07d1831d4af3b376608ebc6c77eb), which I listed there. I'm not sure how much help I'll get asking on Slack so I'm still trying to solve this on my own.

Sprint goals for this week:
 - [ ] Get the Form 1 settings form completed and merged
 - [ ] Get QI-8028, related  to the Form1 settings completed and merged
 - [ ] Complete QI-8800 Cosmetic Changes ticket
 - [ ] Get a PR out for small QI-11756 Update Custodian validation ticket

Todo:
 - [x] Figure out if there was an issue with [QI-10886 Grassroots Disclaimer Footer](:/1fa6606d979b4c90935e9f1011376322), are the disclaimers showing up when they should be?
 - [x] Open PR for [QI-8424 Other Information Form](:/cbcf07d1831d4af3b376608ebc6c77eb)
- [x] Look over new Sprint tickets once they're there
- [x] Submit professional development reimbursement
- [ ] Fix bad import causing large bundle size (see [slack thread](https://quorumanalytics.slack.com/archives/CT1K6K4ES/p1631565630000900?thread_ts=1631563988.000300&cid=CT1K6K4ES))

Tomorrow's focus: Get everything in the Form1 settings ticket done *except* all redux-form issues you're having. Be lax trying to test the things that don't work - and don't test anything yet.
