## Reflect, Reset Recover
Suggeted by [Rich](https://quorumanalytics.slack.com/archives/CN55T5PEV/p1676049419725909),
- Reflect: How was the past week? What accomplishments, big or small, can I celebrate? What were the challenges?
	- Fixing cypress tests, Form 1, getting started on in-kinds
- Reset: What do I want to do next week? What lessons do I want to take forward? Do I want to try anything different?
	- Tomorrow will be a busy week, because I need to finish things up before President's day weekend. Stay focused on goals.
- Recover: Take time for self care. Go for a walk. Call a friend or relative. Put on your favorite tunes and dance.

## Next Week
- Did QPAC-1070 finally get merged. Get this merged!!!
- For QPAC-1156, make everything optional
- Start work on UI for In-Kinds
	- Put everything behind feature flag
