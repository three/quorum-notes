## Draft Answers (copied from Lattice)

### How did you make an impact on your team, department, or Quorum? What accomplishments are you most proud of so far?
My most significant contributions in this review period have been to the PAC product. This includes overhauling the receipts and disbursements forms, transactions bulk upload and accompanying "embellsished CSV" feature whereas users are emailed an attachment on failed bulk uploads, updating archival logic for related objects, creating settings pages, and updating the Form 1 filing flow, and adding logic to support historical Form 1's.

The Form 1 epic also required understanding what was completed in the code, providing SWAG estimates and working with Kristen to create tickets for further work. I've communicated with Beecher about our similar work within the filing flow, so we could share effort and coordinate changes in similar parts of the code.

I’ve continued to do first round technical interviews with candidates including developers that we eventually brought on. I have continued to participate in 24-hour on-call rotations, including active monitoring to recognize potential issues and reacting to genie alerts.

I’ve contributed to the fullstack guild by providing feedback on suggestions and improvements to the frontend codebase, and have. This work includes the typescript implementation project, where we’re trying to move the frontend codebase to support Typescript, including doing a learning lab on the benefits of moving to Typescript.

I have been active in improving the developer experience and helping other developers get onboarded. In response to questions from other developers I’ve actively maintained the Non-Docker setup guide which has been useful in onboarding PAC and Team yellow members, as well as serving as a reference for the rest of the team. I have maintained scripts in the quorum-devtools repository to smooth the experience of onboarding. I've answered questions from new, including those using the Docker setup.

I’ve continued to help developers on other teams, for instance continuing to help with lead ads and jumping into opsgenie alert threads on Slack to help or suggest possible problems. I've continued to help PAC team members onboard.

### Provide specific example(s) of how you’ve embodied our Company Values
I've owned the execution by keeping the team up to date on the progress of my contributions, including in standups, one on ones and slack messages with teammates. During the ongoing Form 1 epic I've given regular updates during standups and worked with Kristen to keep updated on my progress.

### In what area(s) do you see an opportunity to improve upon, in your performance? How do you plan to address these areas for improvement in the next 6-12 months?
I continue to look for more opportunities for leadership, and believe I can take an even greater role in the planning of epics and larger projects, including projects that involve multiple members of the team. I think there could be opportunities in this area as we smooth out federal and move toward feature parity with CPAC. I'm also looking forward to the launch of PAC where we can get feedback from real customers, and the changes that makes to the development process.

### What goal(s) do you have for yourself in regards to your professional development over the next 6-12 months?
Beyond looking for opportunities for leadership I'm looking to move to the Senior Software Engineer role. I'm acting at the level of Senior within many of the bullets of the growth framework, including contributing to larger projects, providing scoping and estimates, pair programming and mentoring, and promoting team impact. If I'm not up to the standards of Senior within this review cycle, I'm looking for where I can improve to grow and develop into that role.

### What support from your manager do you need to achieve your goals in the next 6-12 months?
Let me know during 1-1s of any updates in future projects and epics I could have a role in, such as state filing. Let me know of where I'm doing well and where I'm falling behind.
