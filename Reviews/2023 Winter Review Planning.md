## Draft Answers

### How did you make an impact on your team, department, or Quorum? What accomplishments are you most proud of so far?

My most significant work in my time at Quorum continues to be the PAC product.. This includes overhauling the receipts and disbursements forms, transactions bulk upload and accompanying "embellsished CSV" feature whereas users are emailed an attachment on failed bulk uploads, updating archival logic for related objects, creating settings pages, and updating the Form 1 filing flow, and adding logic to support historical Form 1's.

I’ve continued to do first round technical interviews with candidates including two developers that we eventually brought on. I have continued to participate in 24-hour on-call rotations, including active monitoring to recognize potential issues and reacting to genie alerts.

I’ve contributed to the fullstack guild by providing feedback on suggestions and improvements to the frontend codebase, and have. This work includes the typescript implementation project, where we’re trying to move the frontend codebase to support Typescript, including doing a learning lab on the benefits of moving to Typescript.

I have been active in improving the developer experience and helping other developers get onboarded. In response to questions from other developers I’ve actively maintained the Non-Docker setup guide which has been useful in onboarding PAC and Team yellow members, as well as serving as a reference for the rest of the team. I have maintained scripts in the quorum-devtools repository to smooth the experience of onboarding.

I’ve continued to help developers on other teams, for instance continuing to help with lead ads and jumping into opsgenie alert threads on Slack to help or suggest possible problems. I've continued to help PAC team members onboard.

### Provide specific example(s) of how you’ve embodied our Company Values

I have embraced the rumble by continually suggesting and working toward improvements to improve the codebase and developer tooling. I’ve advocated strongly for Typescript and made an effort to convince people this is the right path, speaking up in fullstack guild meetings, presenting on the benefits during one and one and talking with developers one-on-one to win supporters. I’ve been a member of the fullstack guild meetings, where a lot of these discussions are able to take place, and try to encourage others during these meetings to be vocal as well.

Additionally, I've invested in people by making it a priority to answer questions and help onboard new team members and help them understand the codebase. This means meeting new team members such as Beecher and Keith.
